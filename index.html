      <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

      <p>
        By recognizing that nearly all data is rooted in our physical world, and thus inherently grounded in geometry and physics, it becomes evident that representation learning should preserve this grounding in order to remain meaningful. For example, preserving group transformation laws and symmetries through equivariant layers is crucial in domains such as computational physics, chemistry, robotics, and medical imaging, and leads to effective and generalizable architectures and improved data efficiency. Similarly, in generative models applied to non-Euclidean data spaces, maintaining the manifold structure is essential in order to obtain meaningful samples. Therefore, this workshop focuses on the principle of <em>grounding in geometry</em>, which we define as follows:
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><span style="color: rgb(255, 136, 0);">A representation, method, or theory is grounded in geometry if it can be amenable to geometric reasoning, that is, it abides by the mathematics of geometry and physics.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
